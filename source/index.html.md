# mbed Project Indexer

Welcome to the mbed Indexer API documentation! You can use this API to get data
about mbed projects, create new projects in the indexer, or modify existing
projects.

A "project" is simply a resource which describes where to find source code for
a program that is compatible with an [ARM mbed enabled platform](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/?mbed-enabled=15).
The resource also includes lots of other useful data which describes the project.
This data can be used by other services enabling features such as importing an
mbed project into a development environment, or looking up which projects are
compatible with a given mbed platform.

The API supports features such as pagination, sorting, and filtering of results.

The API is designed to conform to the [JSON API spec](http://jsonapi.org), so both
server and client are obliged follow the specification in order to process valid
requests.


# The JSON API Content Type
All requests and responses which carry a JSON document must set the `Content-Type`
header to the JSON API content type to: `application/vnd.api+json`

Also the relevant `Accept` headers can be set in accordance with the spec.
Please see the section about [content negotiation](http://jsonapi.org/format/#content-negotiation-clients)
in the JSON API spec for more information on client responsibilities when handling JSON API requests/responses.


# The Project Resource
Projects have a list of attributes, many of which are derived from metadata from
the project's repository. These attributes will appear in the JSON data of a
response from the API. Below is a table with descriptions of each of the project
resource's attributes, and whether they are editable via the indexer API.
